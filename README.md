## Project Overview

This project implements a versatile drum machine and synthesizer using the ESP32 microcontroller and the Mozzi audio synthesis library. The codebase includes multiple implementations showcasing different audio output methods and feature sets, from basic internal DAC output to advanced web-controlled drum machines with external DACs.

## Getting Started

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) for VS Code
2. Open desired project folder
3. Build and upload: `pio run --target upload`
4. For web versions: Connect to WiFi AP and open browser to IP address

### Configuration
- Each project includes a `platformio.ini` file with ESP32-specific settings
- Modify `config_wifi.h` for custom WiFi settings (web versions)
- Audio output pins and DAC settings can be adjusted in the respective configuration files
